    <h1>Introduction to PL/SQL </h1>

    <p>PL/SQL stands for procedural language; structured query language is known to be a block structured language. This was developed by Oracle corporation in the year 1980s. It is the Oracle corporationâ€™s extension for SQL and also the relational database. This is also available in Oracle Database since version 7 which stores procedures, functions, packages, triggers. Times Ten in-memory database since the version 11.2.1 and also IBM DB 2 since the version 9.7. it is said that the Oracle corporation usually uses PL/SQL functionality with the different successive releases of each oracle database. </p>
    <p>The PL/SQL language also includes procedural language elements like conditions and loops. PL/SQL allows declarations of constants and also variables of those types and also triggers. It can handle exceptions that are run time errors.</p><br><br>

    <h1>Advantages of  PL/SQL </h1>
    <p>The major advantages of PL/SQL are discussed below : </p>

    <li><b> Support For Sql : </b> PL/SQL allows the use of all sql command, as well as all the sql functions, operations and data types. So, you can manipluate ORACLE data flexible and safely. </li><br><br>

    <li><b> Block structure : </b> PL/SQL is a block-structured language .Each program written in PL/SQL is written as a block. Blocks can also be nested. Each block is meant for a particular task. PL/SQL blocks can be stored in the database and resused. </li><br><br>

    <li><b> Better performance : </b>Without PL/SQL, Oracle server processes sql statements one at a time. Each sql result statement in another call to oracle server, which will increase netwrok traffic heavily. However, with PL/SQL, an entrie block can be sent to oracle server at a time. This will reduce communication between application and oracle server and ultimately it improves the performance. </li><br><br>

    <li><b> Integration : </b> As PL/SQL is the product of oracle corporation. So, it integrates well with sql *plus and other application development products of oracle. It bridges the gap between convenient access to database technology and the need for procedural programming capabilities. </li><br><br>

    <li><b> Protability : </b> Application written in PL/SQL are portable to any platfrom on which oracle runs. Once you write a program in PL/SQL, it can be used in any environment without any change at all. </li><br><br>

    <li><b> Error Handling : </b> PL/SQL handle error or exceptions effectively during, the exceution of a PL/SQL program. Once an exception is caught, specific action can be taken depending upon the type of the exception or it can be displayed to the user with a message.</li><br><br><br><br>
